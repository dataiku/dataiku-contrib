# Airtable plugin

This plugin allows one to get records from a [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) table.

As of September 2018, the API lacks of methods to manage the schema of a table. Hence, this plugin does not offer writing/export to Airtable. However, you can use the update endpoint of the API to update existing fields.

## Changelog

**Version 0.1.1 (2018-09-06)**

* Add option to retrieve row ID

**Version 0.1.0 (2017-11-17)**
