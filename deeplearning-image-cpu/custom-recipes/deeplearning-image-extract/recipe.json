It is recommended to use the neural network's latest dense layers, usually the one before the classification layer (penultimate).<br />This recipe takes as input a folder of images and another folder containing a pre-trained model. It outputs a dataset containing the image path and a vector column with the output of each neuron in the selected layer.<br />This is meant to be used for **feature extraction**, which can then be used for transfer learning in the Dataiku DSS machine learning engine. <br>",
