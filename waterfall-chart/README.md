# Waterfall chart

This Dataiku DSS plugin adds a custom chart, the waterfall chart.

Waterfall charts are useful to visualize the cumulative effect of sequential events, introducing either positive or negative values.

This chart is based on the [Google Charts library](https://developers.google.com/chart/) and requires internet access to render on your datasets.
