# Flow charts

This Dataiku DSS plugin helps you create, without code, charts to visualise transfers, transitions or other types of flow.

It contains several webapps for different flavors of the Sankey chart.

The charts are based on the [Google Charts library](https://developers.google.com/chart/) and requires internet access.
